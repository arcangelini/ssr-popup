# ssr-popup

Adds a popup window to view the system status report and then applies styles to it. The SSR is not removed, only hidden.

Edit the options at the top if you wish to. I have bound the keyboard shortcut to `SHIFT + CONTROL + e`, but you can change also in the options. Ping me with any bugs. Consider this the beta.

PS, due to the way react loads the chat messages in a dynamic grid the height may seem a bit tweaky. Scrolling up annd down in the chat transcript should smooth it out.
